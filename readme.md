# AchieveIt-Backend

Private Course Project.

For cooperation within group only.

## Prerequisite

Here are the list of the services the project depends on:

- Mysql/Mariadb
- Redis
- Openjdk-11

It is recommended to develop the project in a Linux environment for its convenience in setting up required services. However, Windows will also be OK, at least we have WSL on it :)
