# AchieveIt-Backend

Private Course Project.

For cooperation within group only.

## Prerequisite

Here are the list of the services the project depends on:

- Mysql/Mariadb
- Redis
- Openjdk-11

*If you are using MySQL 5.7, run sql`set global sql_mode='ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION'` to prevent creating table issues.*

It is recommended to develop the project in a Linux environment for its convenience in setting up required services. However, Windows will also be OK, at least we have WSL on it :)
